Physics model and equations
===========================

`sfincs_jax` solves a **radially local, steady-state drift-kinetic problem** on a
single flux surface. This page summarizes the governing model, the main approximations,
and how the physics terms map onto the discretized operators documented in
:doc:`system_equations`, :doc:`geometry`, and :doc:`numerics`.
For full derivations and code-location detail, see :doc:`physics_reference` and
:doc:`source_map`.

Model overview
--------------

`sfincs_jax` evolves the non-adiabatic perturbation :math:`f_{s1}` about a Maxwellian
background :math:`f_{s0}` on a single flux surface:

.. math::

   f_s = f_{s0} + f_{s1}.

In normalized variables, the linearized drift-kinetic equation (DKE) can be written as

.. math::

   \mathcal{L}_s[f_{s1}] = S_s,

where the operator :math:`\mathcal{L}_s` includes streaming, mirror force,
:math:`E\times B` drifts, magnetic drifts, energy/pitch-angle drift terms, and the
linearized collision operator. The source :math:`S_s` contains thermodynamic drives,
the inductive electric field, and the RHSMode-specific forcing used in transport
matrix calculations. [#sfincs2015]_

Background distribution and normalized variables
------------------------------------------------

The code uses the normalized variables

.. math::

   x_s = \frac{v}{\sqrt{2T_s/m_s}},
   \qquad
   \xi = \frac{v_\parallel}{v},
   \qquad
   \mu = \frac{v_\perp^2}{2B},

with a background state

.. math::

   f_{s0} =
   n_s \left(\frac{m_s}{2\pi T_s}\right)^{3/2}
   \exp(-x_s^2)

or, when the flux-surface-varying potential is included,

.. math::

   f_{s0} =
   f_{sM}\exp\!\left(-\frac{Z_s e \Phi_1}{T_s}\right).

The normalization conventions used for hats and dimensionless drives are summarized in
:doc:`normalizations`. These conventions matter directly for the coefficients assembled by
the consolidated :class:`sfincs_jax.drift_kinetic.KineticOperator` and the diagnostics
written by :mod:`sfincs_jax.writer`.

Geometry and guiding-center drifts
----------------------------------

The guiding-center drifts can be expressed (in physical variables) as

.. math::

   \mathbf{v}_m
   =
   \frac{v_\parallel^2}{\Omega_s}\,\mathbf{b}\times(\mathbf{b}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{b})
   + \frac{\mu}{\Omega_s}\,\mathbf{b}\times\nabla B,

and the :math:`E\times B` drift as

.. math::

   \mathbf{v}_E = \frac{c}{B^2}\,\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}.

SFINCS evaluates the geometric coefficients using Boozer-like straight-field-line
coordinates (especially for ``geometryScheme=11/12``), and the discrete operator
uses those coefficients to build the drift terms in the DKE. [#boozer1980]_

Collision operators
-------------------

SFINCS Fortran v3 supports two collision models, and `sfincs_jax` adds a third:

- **Pitch-angle scattering (PAS)** (``collisionOperator = 1``): a
  diagonal-in-:math:`L` operator used for reduced models and benchmark suites.
- **Full linearized Fokker–Planck (Landau)** (``collisionOperator = 0``):
  implemented via Rosenbluth potentials
  and dense coupling in the speed coordinate. This is the default for high-fidelity
  multispecies studies.
- **Improved Sugama model operator** (``collisionOperator = 3``): the momentum-
  and energy-conserving improved linearized model operator of Sugama *et al.*
  (2019), a `sfincs_jax` research extension beyond Fortran v3 that remains
  accurate into the highly collisional regime.

The linearized FP operator is the most accurate model for neoclassical transport in
SFINCS and is the basis for the collision-driven preconditioners used in `sfincs_jax`.

Constraint closure and source/sink terms
----------------------------------------

The discrete linear system is closed by auxiliary constraints. In the common linear
formulation these are equivalent to enforcing

.. math::

   \left\langle \int d^3v \, f_{s1} \right\rangle = 0,
   \qquad
   \left\langle \int d^3v \, v^2 f_{s1} \right\rangle = 0,

with optional quasineutrality and gauge conditions when :math:`\Phi_1` is solved:

.. math::

   \lambda + \sum_s Z_s \int d^3v \, (f_{s0}+f_{s1}) = 0,
   \qquad
   \langle \Phi_1 \rangle = 0.

These conditions remove nullspaces associated with conservation laws and determine the
algebraic branch selected by the solve.

Phi1 and quasineutrality
------------------------

When ``includePhi1 = .true.``, SFINCS solves for the **flux-surface variation of the
electrostatic potential** :math:`\Phi_1(\theta,\zeta)` via a quasineutrality constraint.
The resulting potential modifies the kinetic equation and the collision operator
through poloidal density variations. This physics is especially important for impurity
transport and flows in stellarators. [#phi1_2018]_

Transport coefficients
----------------------

Transport-matrix modes (``RHSMode=2/3``) solve the same linearized DKE with multiple
right-hand sides and postprocess the solutions into particle/heat fluxes and FSAB
flows. These coefficients are the basis for neoclassical transport predictions and
bootstrap current calculations in SFINCS. [#sfincs2015]_

The main moments of interest are built from velocity-space and flux-surface integrals,
schematically

.. math::

   \Gamma_s = \left\langle \int d^3v \, f_{s1}\,\mathbf{v}_{d,s}\cdot\nabla r \right\rangle,

.. math::

   Q_s = \left\langle \int d^3v \, \frac{m_s v^2}{2} f_{s1}\,\mathbf{v}_{d,s}\cdot\nabla r \right\rangle,

.. math::

   V_{\parallel,s} = \left\langle \int d^3v \, v_\parallel f_{s1} \right\rangle,
   \qquad
   j_\parallel = \sum_s Z_s e V_{\parallel,s}.

`sfincs_jax` evaluates these moments in :mod:`sfincs_jax.moments` (with
geometry-derived scalars in :mod:`sfincs_jax.magnetic_geometry`).

Trajectory-model knobs
----------------------

The physical model is intentionally configurable. The most important switches are:

- ``magneticDriftScheme`` for magnetic-drift terms,
- ``useDKESExBDrift`` for DKES-like vs full :math:`E\times B` advection,
- ``includeXDotTerm`` and the corresponding :math:`\dot \xi` electric-field term,
- ``collisionOperator`` for PAS vs full FP,
- ``includePhi1`` / ``includePhi1InKineticEquation`` /
  ``includePhi1InCollisionOperator`` for flux-surface-varying electrostatic physics.

The detailed switch-to-equation map is given in :doc:`system_equations`.
