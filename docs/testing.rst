Testing, validation, and CI
===========================

`sfincs_jax` is validated with a layered testing strategy. The code is not trusted
because any single benchmark happens to pass; it is trusted because the operator,
solvers, output writer, and public workflows are all exercised at multiple levels.

Validation philosophy
---------------------

The validation stack is organized from local to global:

1. **Unit tests** for grids, geometry, collisions, solver heuristics, and CLI behavior.
2. **Regression tests** for previously broken branches and edge cases.
3. **Output tests** for ``sfincsOutput.h5`` generation and dataset integrity.
4. **Example-suite audits** that compare full case outputs against frozen reference
   artifacts.
5. **Benchmark smoke tests** for transport parallelism and scaling scripts.

This layered approach reduces the risk of shipping a numerically correct but operationally
fragile code, or a fast code that quietly changed the physics.

What is compared
----------------

The main release-facing checks compare:

- scalar diagnostics,
- arrays in ``sfincsOutput.h5``,
- transport matrices,
- selected terminal signals,
- and, where appropriate, strict tolerances on all datasets in the audited suite.

Comparisons against the mature Fortran implementation are used as a validation anchor,
not as the public identity of the code. The purpose of those checks is to show that the
standalone `sfincs_jax` implementation reproduces trusted neoclassical physics on the
supported audited scope.

Test categories
---------------

Unit and regression tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``tests/`` tree includes:

- physics-term tests (streaming, drifts, collisions),
- geometry/output tests for each supported geometry family,
- solve-path heuristic tests,
- CLI and input-override tests,
- parallel benchmark smoke tests,
- and output-writing end-to-end tests.

Representative examples:

- ``tests/test_output_h5_scheme5_parity.py``
- ``tests/test_transport_parallel.py``
- ``tests/test_cli_solve_mode.py``
- ``tests/test_full_system_gmres_solution_parity.py``
- ``tests/test_rhs1_schwarz_heuristic.py``

Full suite and release checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The release-facing example-suite artifacts on ``main`` are generated from the full
39-case CPU and GPU audits recorded in the repository. Those audits are summarized in
the README and the performance/validation pages.

For current release documentation, the important point is simple:

- all cases in the audited suite complete on CPU and GPU,
- no ``jax_error`` or ``max_attempts`` entries remain in the release artifacts,
- and the frozen-reference comparisons are clean on the documented scope.

Continuous integration
----------------------

The repository is kept buildable and testable through standard CI-style commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest -q
   sphinx-build -W -b html docs docs/_build/html

The same checks are also represented in the repository CI/CD configuration:

- ``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` runs the test matrix and example smoke tests,
- the same CI workflow also runs the audited coverage job and uploads ``coverage.xml``
  through Codecov using GitHub OIDC,
- ``.github/workflows/docs.yml`` builds the Sphinx documentation,
- ``.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml`` handles packaging/release publication.

The current audited full-suite command on ``main`` is:

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest -q --cov=sfincs_jax --cov-report=term --cov-report=xml

On the current audited local release tree this command yields ``462 passed`` and
roughly ``51%`` package coverage. That number is materially higher than the Linux
CI runner floor, but it also makes the remaining gap explicit: the dominant uncovered
surface is still the large solver/geometry stack, especially ``v3_driver.py``,
``io.py``, ``geometry.py``, ``grids.py``, and ``vmec_geometry.py``. Reaching a
research-grade coverage target therefore requires more focused tests on those heavy
modules rather than more trivial helper tests.

The documentation build is part of the release discipline, not a separate afterthought.
If a docs change breaks Sphinx or leaves pages internally inconsistent, it should be
treated as a real regression.

How to work safely
------------------

When changing physics, numerics, or performance-sensitive logic:

1. add or update a focused unit/regression test,
2. run the targeted tests for the touched functionality,
3. run the docs build if the public behavior changed,
4. rerun a representative case or benchmark if performance-sensitive code changed,
5. rerun broader validation before release.

Research reproducibility
------------------------

The repository includes:

- frozen fixtures in ``tests/ref``,
- example inputs in ``examples/sfincs_examples`` and ``examples/upstream``,
- benchmark scripts in ``examples/performance``,
- and generated figures in ``docs/_static/figures``.

That structure is intended to make claims in the docs reproducible. If a figure or
table appears in the docs, there should be a script or artifact trail that explains how
it was produced.
