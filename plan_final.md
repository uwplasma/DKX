# SFINCS_JAX Final Research-Grade Implementation Plan

Last updated: 2026-06-25 (America/Chicago)

Active branch: `refactor/rhs1-full-assembly-preconditioners`

Review surface: draft PR #8, `refactor/v3-driver-architecture`

Status: this file is the controlling completion plan. `plan.md` remains the
execution log and historical record; future work should update this file only
when the target plan itself changes.

## One-Sentence Goal

Finish `sfincs_jax` as a compact, domain-organized, production-grade
neoclassical transport code: users provide a geometry and input file and get
accurate CPU/GPU results with automatic robust solver selection, while Python
users can opt into end-to-end differentiable residual, flux, ambipolar, and
optimization workflows with parity against SFINCS Fortran v3 wherever the
physics models overlap.

Reference decks and probe summaries for the ambipolar functionality live in
`benchmarks/fortran_v3_ambipolar_reference/`. These decks pin the source-code
behavior of `ambipolarSolveOption=1`, `2`, and `3` before the sfincs_jax
implementation begins.

Implementation progress on 2026-06-23:

- `sfincs_jax.problems.ambipolar` now owns the first-class ambipolar problem,
  iteration, and result contracts.
- The Fortran-compatible Brent root path is implemented and tested against the
  checked-in small and production Fortran v3 ambipolar summaries.
- The Fortran v3 ambipolar reference matrix now covers geometry-1 helical and
  geometry-4 W7-X-like decks at small and production tiers for options 1, 2,
  and 3, with PETSc/KSP/MUMPS profiling markers and `/usr/bin/time -lp` RSS
  summaries.
- The source-code validator for Fortran-compatible ambipolar restrictions is
  implemented for the reference decks and derivative-assisted option guards.
- The Brent owner can now evaluate real RHSMode 1 radial currents through
  in-process `write_sfincs_jax_output_h5` calls, records per-evaluation
  artifacts, and is exposed through `sfincs_jax ambipolar`.
- Each real ambipolar evaluation now records solver-trace provenance
  (selected path, residual, target, setup/solve/elapsed time, active size),
  uses an ambipolar-local geometry/output cache across `E_r` evaluations, and
  carries a shape-checked Krylov state file for warm starts/recycled basis
  reuse between nearby electric-field solves.
- RHSMode 1 active field-split symbolic orderings now use a package-level
  semantic fixed-shape key, so structured CSR and true-operator rescue paths
  can reuse active/full index maps across same-shape solves without reusing
  stale `E_r`-dependent numerical matrices or factors.
- A finite-difference `dJr/dEr` helper now provides the numerical derivative
  gate that implicit/adjoint derivatives must match.
- `sfincs_jax.sensitivity` now owns a reusable implicit linear-observable
  derivative certificate. It solves both the tangent equation and the adjoint
  equation, reports primal/tangent/adjoint residuals, and can compare the
  derivative against centered finite differences.
- The same module now exposes a fixed-shape `LinearObservableSystem` builder
  bridge. Concrete RHSMode 1/4/5 owners can provide the true operator, RHS,
  observable, and their scalar-parameter derivatives without coupling the
  ambipolar root solvers back to `v3_driver.py`.
- A bounded `probe_linear_observable_vector` helper can recover `c` and `J0`
  from an existing linear diagnostic `J(x) = c^T x + J0` on small validation
  decks. This is a validation bridge for pinning radial-current weights before
  replacing it with analytic production weights.
- `sfincs_jax.problems.transport_matrix.diagnostics` now exposes
  `radial_current_vm_psi_hat_from_state` and a chunked observable-vector helper
  for the magnetic-drift radial-current contribution, plus explicit
  `psiHat`/`rHat`/`rN` coordinate wrappers. A tiny RHSMode-1 deck checks the
  recovered vector against the existing diagnostic.
- `sfincs_jax.problems.ambipolar` now includes a size-limited dense RHSMode-1
  linear-observable builder that assembles the true small-deck operator/RHS,
  finite-differences their scalar-parameter derivatives, and feeds the result
  to the tangent/adjoint certificate. This pins the wiring contract before a
  production sparse/matrix-free implementation.
- `sfincs_jax.sensitivity` now also exposes a matrix-free
  `MatrixFreeLinearObservableSystem` certificate. Production owners can pass
  operator actions, transpose actions, derivative actions, and selected
  solve/transpose-solve closures without dense assembly. Ambipolar adapters
  route this certificate to the same `dJr/dEr` contract used by option-1/3
  Newton solvers.
- `sfincs_jax.problems.ambipolar` now exposes the first concrete RHSMode-1
  matrix-free radial-current builder. It uses the real full-system matrix-free
  operator action, caller-supplied transpose and solve closures, finite-
  difference operator/RHS derivative actions, and existing radial-current
  observable weights; this removes dense matrix assembly from the builder
  itself while keeping a finite-difference promotion gate.
- The same builder now accepts caller-supplied derivative actions or JAX
  operator tangents. `operator_tangent_from_centered_difference` constructs
  valid pytrees with `float0` tangents for integer/bool leaves, and a real
  electric-field `xDot` operator test verifies the JVP action against centered
  differences.
- `matrix_free_radial_current_derivative_provider` now bridges matrix-free
  implicit certificates into safeguarded Newton/bisection and pure Newton
  ambipolar root solvers. Fast option-1/3-style tests verify root convergence,
  derivative metadata, tangent/adjoint consistency, and finite-difference
  agreement through the public solver API.
- No-Phi1 existing-branch `Er` operator tangents now use the v3 radial
  conversion analytically. The helper updates stored `dphi_hat_dpsi_hat` leaves
  in the full operator and f-block suboperators, and a real electric-field
  `xDot` fixture verifies the JVP action against centered operator differences.
- `keep_zero_er_terms` now lets derivative gates retain zero-valued ExB and
  `Er` suboperators at `Er=0` without changing normal solve defaults. A real
  `xDot` fixture verifies that the opt-in zero-`Er` operator is numerically
  identical to the default operator, while its analytic JVP tangent matches
  nearby nonzero centered differences.
- `rhsmode1_radial_current_response_from_namelist` now provides the first
  namelist-backed RHSMode-1 radial-current response and derivative provider.
  A bounded real-deck gate uses fixed-shape zero-`Er` branches, the analytic
  JVP operator tangent, and dense validation closures to compare the implicit
  derivative against centered finite differences without exposing users to
  manual plus/minus operator assembly.
- The namelist-backed RHSMode-1 response now validates on Fortran-style active
  pitch-mode DOFs instead of the rectangular inactive-mode storage. It defaults
  to the Fortran ambipolar `particleFlux_vm_rN` current convention, infers the
  radial conversion from the namelist, and replays the checked
  `geometry1_helical_small_option1` Fortran option-1 current and Newton slope
  within `2e-5` relative tolerance.
- The same active provider also replays the checked small option-3 physical
  currents for `geometry1_helical_small_option3` and
  `geometry4_w7x_like_small_option3` within `2e-5` relative tolerance.
- `solve_rhsmode1_ambipolar_from_namelist` now wires that active provider into
  the real option-1/2/3 ambipolar root policies. Bounded small-deck helical
  option-1 and option-3 roots replay the checked Fortran v3 roots using the
  active `particleFlux_vm_rN` response rather than a synthetic table.
- `sfincs_jax.sensitivity` now exposes `jvp_flux`, `vjp_flux`, and
  `adjoint_dot_product_check`. The focused tests apply the dot-product identity
  to real RHSMode-1 particle-flux, heat-flux, flow, radial-current, and
  bootstrap-current diagnostics, which is the same consistency gate required
  before promoting RHSMode 4/5 adjoint outputs.
- `sfincs_jax.sensitivity` also owns the first RHSMode-4/5 Fortran source
  contract helpers. `validate_fortran_v3_adjoint_sensitivity_constraints`
  mirrors the `validateInput.F90` adjoint restrictions, and
  `fortran_v3_adjoint_sensitivity_output_fields` pins the HDF5 sensitivity
  fields written by `writeHDF5Output.F90`, including the source-code
  `dParallelFlowdLambda` gate.
- `benchmarks/fortran_v3_sensitivity_reference` now contains compact numerical
  RHSMode-4 Fortran summaries for tiny W7-X-like analytic radial-current and
  heat-flux sensitivity decks. Checked tests pin the HDF5 field names, tensor
  ranks, wall/RSS budgets, `dRadialCurrentdLambda = sum_s Z_s
  dParticleFlux_s/dLambda`, and `dTotalHeatFluxdLambda = sum_s
  dHeatFlux_s/dLambda` without committing generated HDF5 files.
- Derivative-assisted safeguarded Newton/bisection and strict pure-Newton root
  solvers are implemented behind the same ambipolar owner. They accept a
  derivative provider, so finite-difference gates, direct implicit
  certificates, and builder-backed implicit certificates can be wired in
  without changing the root-solve contract.
- `docs/feature_matrix.rst` now records the audited Fortran-v3 feature owners,
  the matching `sfincs_jax` implementation owners, and the promotion gates for
  ambipolar option 1/3, RHSMode 4/5 sensitivities, solver backends, geometry,
  Phi1, outputs, and parallelism.
- Remaining Lane 3 work is deeper fixed-shape numerical operator/factor and
  preconditioner setup reuse behind that evaluator, plus larger-deck physical
  replay gates that run the namelist-backed derivative provider through real
  ambipolar root solves.

Key Fortran v3 algorithm facts to preserve:

- The most general system solves for
  `{f_s1(theta,zeta,x,xi), Phi1(theta,zeta), S_s1, S_s2, lambda}`. Without
  self-consistent `Phi1`, the unknowns reduce to `{f_s1, S_s1, S_s2}`.
- RHSMode 1 solves one physical right-hand side. RHSMode 2 solves three
  right-hand sides for the energy-integrated transport matrix. RHSMode 3 solves
  two monoenergetic right-hand sides with its special `Nx=1` grid convention.
- RHSMode 4 computes adjoint sensitivities at fixed `E_r`. RHSMode 5 computes
  adjoint sensitivities at ambipolar `E_r`.
- `ambipolarSolveOption=1` uses safeguarded Newton/bisection,
  `ambipolarSolveOption=2` uses Brent, and `ambipolarSolveOption=3` uses pure
  Newton.
- Newton-based ambipolar solve options compute `dRadialCurrentdEr` with an
  adjoint solve. The derivative is based on
  `evaluateAdjointInnerProductFactor`, which forms
  `dL/dEr * f - dS/dEr`, followed by the free-energy inner product with the
  adjoint radial-current solution.
- Fortran v3 has a source/manual discrepancy for derivative-assisted
  ambipolar solves: the manual says options 1 and 3 require
  `magneticDriftScheme > 0`, but `validateInput.F90` rejects tangential
  magnetic drifts for `RHSMode>3` and for `ambipolarSolve=.true.` with
  `ambipolarSolveOption != 2`. The implementation plan follows the source:
  options 1 and 3 are validated first with `magneticDriftScheme == 0`, then
  any later tangential-drift extension must be an explicit new sfincs_jax
  capability with its own tests.
- The linear/nonlinear solver stack is PETSc SNES/KSP. Linear cases use one
  SNES step. `includePhi1=true` with self-consistent `Phi1` uses Newton line
  search and nested KSP solves.
- Iterative solves use GMRES with a factorized `PCLU` preconditioner. Direct
  solves use `KSPPREONLY + PCLU`.
- When parallel direct solvers are available, the factorization backend is
  MUMPS or SuperLU_DIST. Serial PETSc direct solves use a sparse ordering,
  typically RCM in v3, with diagonal-pivot safeguards.
- MUMPS robustness is improved by pivot threshold controls and by retrying with
  larger `ICNTL(14)` workspace when factorization fails. This is a solver
  policy and residual-admission pattern that `sfincs_jax` should mimic
  natively, not by depending on PETSc.
- For RHSMode 2/3, Fortran v3 builds the operator once, reuses the factorized
  operator/preconditioner across the right-hand sides, and only changes the
  drive terms.
- For adjoints, Fortran v3 reuses the transpose operator path through either a
  separately built adjoint matrix or `KSPSolveTranspose`.

### Ambipolar Probe Results From Fortran v3

Completed local probes on 2026-06-22 and 2026-06-23 used
`/Users/rogeriojorge/local/sfincs/fortran/version3/sfincs` and the small decks
now checked into `benchmarks/fortran_v3_ambipolar_reference/namelists`. The
new reproducible summaries are
`small_profile_summary_2026-06-23.json` and
`production_profile_summary_2026-06-23.json`; raw PETSc/MUMPS logs stay in the
scratch paths recorded in those JSON files.

Observed facts to feed directly into implementation:

- `geometry4_w7x_like_small_option1`: safeguarded Newton/bisection completed
  with Er evaluations `[-20, 20, 0]`, radial currents about
  `[-1.09e-6, 1.43e-6, 2.51e-8]`, internal Fortran ambipolar time
  `0.143 s`, wall time `75.31 s`, and peak RSS about `135 MB`.
- `geometry4_w7x_like_small_option2`: Brent completed with the same bracket and
  initial point, internal Fortran ambipolar time `0.147 s`, wall time
  `75.66 s`, and peak RSS about `135 MB`.
- `geometry4_w7x_like_small_option3`: pure Newton completed from the initial
  guess, internal Fortran ambipolar time `0.063 s`, wall time `75.19 s`, and
  peak RSS about `120 MB`.
- `geometry1_helical_small_option2`: Brent completed on a distinct analytic
  helical geometry with Er values `[-20, 20, 0, -1.7273, -2.0106]` and final
  radial current about `1.7e-9`; internal Fortran ambipolar time was `0.373 s`,
  wall time was `75.54 s`, peak RSS was about `156 MB`, and the run reported an
  MPI finalization error after writing useful diagnostics.
- `geometry1_helical_small_option1` and `geometry1_helical_small_option3` now
  pin the same analytic helical problem for derivative-assisted Newton paths.
  Option 1 used four forward solves and four adjoint solves; option 3 used two
  forward solves and two adjoint solves. Both reached `|J_r| ~ 1.1e-9`.
- All small probes used MUMPS through PETSc. The logs show repeated full
  `whichMatrix=0` and `whichMatrix=1` setup per Er evaluation, followed by
  residual matrix assembly and diagnostics.
- For these tiny systems, Jacobian sizes alternated between about `19,566` and
  `26,750` nonzeros depending on the Er branch/active terms, while the
  preconditioner had about `15,436`, `19,356`, or `26,750` nonzeros depending
  on deck and preconditioner settings.
- `geometry4_w7x_like_production_option{1,2,3}` completed the larger reference
  deck with `Ntheta=13`, `Nzeta=19`, `Nxi=48`, and `Nx=5`. All three options
  converged to the same root near `Er=-3.57735`. Option 1 used six forward and
  six adjoint solves, option 2 used six forward solves, and option 3 used four
  forward and four adjoint solves. The profiled runs reported internal
  ambipolar times of about `18.7 s`, `13.8 s`, and `12.1 s`, respectively,
  and peak RSS around `1.35-1.39 GB`.
- `geometry1_helical_production_option1` and
  `geometry1_helical_production_option3` converged to `Er=-3.26189` with final
  `|J_r| ~ 6.5e-11`. The same production grid is substantially harder than the
  W7-X-like deck: peak RSS was `5.7-5.8 GB`, option 1 used ten forward plus ten
  adjoint solves, and option 3 used eight forward plus eight adjoint solves.
- `geometry1_helical_production_option2` reached `|J_r| ~ 8.1e-12` but did not
  print Fortran's Brent success marker before exhausting its 12 evaluation
  budget. This is an important policy gate: sfincs_jax should report both the
  best residual found and whether the declared convergence criterion was met,
  rather than treating a small final residual and a success marker as the same
  concept.
- The production decks used MUMPS and assembled matrices with about
  `1.57e6` to `2.28e6` Jacobian nonzeros and about `1.27e6` to `1.54e6`
  preconditioner nonzeros for W7-X-like geometry. The helical production decks
  used the same maximum Jacobian size but an exact preconditioner with up to
  `2.28e6` nonzeros, explaining their higher RSS.
- The large gap between Fortran's internal ambipolar time and process wall time
  comes from process/logging/finalization overhead and verbose MUMPS/PETSc
  diagnostics. sfincs_jax should not emulate this shell-style scan cost; it
  should keep fixed-shape geometry/operator/factor metadata alive across Er
  evaluations.

### Current sfincs_jax State

Current source size snapshot:

- `sfincs_jax/v3_driver.py`: about 12.2k lines.
- `sfincs_jax/rhs1_full_assembly.py`: about 6.0k lines.
- Several RHSMode 1 QI, x-block, sparse policy, output, and transport modules
  still exceed 2k to 4k lines.
- Package total is about 160k Python lines across about 293 Python files.

Useful existing assets:

- JAX-native residual/operator code already exists for large portions of the
  v3 model.
- `sfincs_jax/implicit_solve.py` already wraps `jax.lax.custom_linear_solve`
  for implicit differentiation through linear solves.
- `sfincs_jax/problems/profile_response/phi1_newton.py` already uses
  `jax.linearize` to build Newton-Krylov JVPs.
- `sfincs_jax/ambipolar.py` postprocesses completed Er scans, but does not yet
  provide the Fortran v3 in-solver ambipolar algorithms.
- Several profile-response and transport-matrix preconditioners exist, but the
  implementation surface is still too fragmented and too environment-variable
  driven.
- Docs and examples now include autodiff and optimization demonstrations, but
  they should be recast around a small public API and explicit validation
  contracts.

Important current gaps:

- No first-class RHSMode 4/5 API matching Fortran v3 adjoint diagnostics.
- No in-solver ambipolar root solve matching Fortran v3 options 1, 2, and 3.
- No complete derivative API for `dGamma/dEr`, `dQ/dEr`, `d<J.B>/dEr`,
  `dJr/dEr`, profile sensitivities, and geometry harmonic sensitivities across
  all supported solve lanes.
- Too many solver choices are exposed as low-level environment variables rather
  than automatic, tested policy decisions.
- Code ownership is better than before but still not final: the target is fewer
  domain packages with larger, coherent ownership boundaries, not a growing set
  of one-off files.

Derivative design implications:

- The right default is not to backpropagate through every Krylov iteration or
  every adaptive solver branch. The robust design is an explicit residual graph
  plus implicit differentiation at the converged solution.
- The primal equation is
  `R(u, p) = 0`, with solution `u(p)`.
- Forward sensitivity should use
  `R_u du/dp = -R_p`.
- Reverse sensitivity for scalar objective `J(u, p)` should solve
  `R_u^T lambda = J_u^T`, then use
  `dJ/dp = J_p - lambda^T R_p`.
- This matches the Fortran v3 adjoint structure and the spectral-PDE adjoint
  paper's message: build adjoints from the symbolic residual/operator graph and
  reuse efficient sparse/direct/iterative solves.
- `jax.lax.custom_linear_solve` is the base primitive for differentiating
  linear solve calls without tracing all iterations.
- `custom_jvp` and `custom_vjp` should wrap only stable public solve APIs and
  only when the default JAX transform would trace control flow or host-only
  operations.
- Lineax can be evaluated as an optional operator abstraction or least-squares
  backend, but it should be adopted only if benchmarks show lower compile time,
  lower runtime, lower memory, or cleaner derivative code for a concrete lane.
- T3D and NEOPAX need a profile/flux closure interface, not a file-only
  executable. `sfincs_jax` should expose shape-stable JAX-friendly functions for
  radial batches, Er scans, transport coefficients, ambipolar roots, and
  Jacobian/vector-Jacobian products.

## Product Requirements

### Default User Experience

- CLI users provide `input.namelist` and a geometry path. The default solver
  policy selects a robust and efficient method automatically.
- The terminal output reports phase timings, selected solver path, residual
  target, residual history summary, memory estimate, output file paths, and
  enough progress to judge whether a run will take seconds, minutes, or longer.
- Advanced users can override solver family, preconditioner, differentiability
  mode, output format, and profiling options, but routine runs should not
  require environment variables.

### Python And Optimization Experience

- Python users can call a compact public API:
  `solve_flux_surface`, `solve_transport_matrix`, `solve_ambipolar`,
  `make_flux_closure`, and `make_objective`.
- Differentiable mode is explicit and documented. It returns pytrees with
  solution, diagnostics, residual certificates, and derivative capabilities.
- Non-differentiable mode can use faster host/direct paths when called from the
  CLI or from Python with `differentiable=False`.
- The API should support optimization workflows such as:
  bootstrap-current minimization, ambipolar electron-root targeting, particle
  and heat flux minimization, impurity flux targeting, sensitivity analysis,
  inverse design, uncertainty quantification, and profile evolution coupling.

### Research-Grade Claim Boundary

Public claims require all of the following:

- Numerical residual passes the true operator residual gate.
- Shared outputs match SFINCS Fortran v3 within documented tolerances.
- CPU and GPU either match within tolerance or the difference is documented and
  gated.
- Runtime and peak memory are measured from fresh cold and warm runs.
- The exact resolution, device, commit, Python/JAX versions, and solver path
  are recorded.
- For derivative claims, JVP/VJP/adjoint results pass finite-difference checks
  on stable windows and transpose/adjoint residual checks.
- For optimization examples, the plotted improvement must come from a
  reproducible script, not a hand-edited artifact.

## Final Architecture Target

The final codebase should have a small number of domain packages. New files are
allowed only when they create a clear owner boundary. One-function wrappers and
historical compatibility facades should be deleted as their callers migrate.

Target package boundaries:

| Package | Ownership |
| --- | --- |
| `sfincs_jax.api` | Public Python API, stable return objects, high-level solve entry points. |
| `sfincs_jax.cli` | CLI parsing, user-facing progress, plotting, profiling switches. |
| `sfincs_jax.config` | Namelist/TOML parsing, defaults, validation, Fortran-compatible coercions. |
| `sfincs_jax.geometry` | Analytic, VMEC, Boozer, Miller, `vmec_jax`, and `booz_xform_jax` adapters. |
| `sfincs_jax.discretization` | Grids, quadrature, interpolation, finite differences, radial-coordinate conversion. |
| `sfincs_jax.operators` | Drift-kinetic residuals, Jacobians, RHS builders, collision/source/Phi1 blocks. |
| `sfincs_jax.solvers` | Linear/nonlinear solve policies, native factors, Krylov, preconditioners, implicit solves. |
| `sfincs_jax.problems` | Problem orchestration for profile response, transport matrices, monoenergetic, ambipolar, adjoint sensitivity. |
| `sfincs_jax.outputs` | HDF5/netCDF/NPZ writing, restart/recycle state, diagnostics schema, plotting payloads. |
| `sfincs_jax.sensitivity` | JVP/VJP, implicit differentiation, adjoint diagnostics, finite-difference checks. |
| `sfincs_jax.workflows` | Radial scans, optimization objectives, T3D/NEOPAX closures, publication figures. |
| `sfincs_jax.validation` | Parity reports, benchmark harnesses, physics gates, artifact policies. |

Structural rules:

- Keep domain files under about 1500 lines when practical. Exceptions require a
  short owner comment at the top explaining why the file is intentionally large.
- Prefer fewer coherent owner files over many small wrappers.
- Do not keep duplicate names like `v3_*`, `rhs1_*`, and `transport_*` when a
  domain name is clearer.
- Compatibility shims get a deletion issue/date in this plan and must have a
  focused import-contract test while they exist.
- Every moved owner boundary gets at least one test that imports the canonical
  owner and one test that exercises behavior through the public API.

## Lane 1 - Refactor To Stable Domain Ownership

Goal: remove `v3_driver.py` as a monolith without scattering equivalent
complexity across many small files.

Milestones:

1. Freeze the current public behavior with focused API, CLI, and parity tests.
2. Move namelist validation and Fortran compatibility rules into
   `sfincs_jax.config`.
3. Move all remaining grid, index, and radial-coordinate conversion logic into
   `sfincs_jax.discretization`.
4. Move matrix/residual/RHS builders into `sfincs_jax.operators`, grouped by
   physical block rather than by historical RHSMode filename.
5. Move problem orchestration into `sfincs_jax.problems`, with each problem
   exposing a small `setup -> solve -> diagnose -> output` pipeline.
6. Collapse redundant QI, x-block, sparse-PC, and policy files into coherent
   solver families under `sfincs_jax.solvers`.
7. Delete compatibility facades once all tests and docs import canonical names.
8. Reduce `v3_driver.py` to either zero lines or a deprecated shim under 300
   lines that only calls public APIs.

Acceptance gates:

- `v3_driver.py` no longer owns physics equations, solver policy, output
  schema, or QI/preconditioner internals.
- No new package has more than three files with overlapping solver-policy
  responsibility.
- Source file count decreases or stays roughly flat after compatibility shims
  are deleted.
- Public API examples and CLI examples run unchanged.
- Focused refactor tests run in under 2 minutes locally.

## Lane 2 - Full Fortran v3 Functionality Matrix

Goal: make the Fortran v3 feature surface explicit and either implemented,
tested, or documented as intentionally unsupported.

Feature matrix:

| Feature | Current target |
| --- | --- |
| RHSMode 1 profile response | Keep parity, improve automatic solver selection, finish production-grid gates. |
| RHSMode 2 energy-integrated transport matrix | Keep parity, reuse operator/factors across RHS, production-floor CPU/GPU reports. |
| RHSMode 3 monoenergetic transport matrix | Keep parity, preserve special grid normalization, compare with DKES-style literature gates. |
| RHSMode 4 adjoint sensitivities at fixed Er | Implement first-class API and HDF5/netCDF outputs. |
| RHSMode 5 adjoint sensitivities at ambipolar Er | Implement after Lane 3 ambipolar and Lane 6 adjoint transpose solve are stable. |
| `ambipolarSolveOption=1` | Implement safeguarded Newton/bisection with `dJr/dEr` from implicit/adjoint solve. |
| `ambipolarSolveOption=2` | Implement Brent root solve using completed physical solves and scan reuse. |
| `ambipolarSolveOption=3` | Implement pure Newton with robust failure certificate and fallback suggestion. |
| `includePhi1` self-consistent | Keep nonlinear Newton-Krylov parity and output all SNES-like diagnostics. |
| `readExternalPhi1` | Add or audit file input parity and cheaper fixed-Phi1 solves. |
| `includePhi1InCollisionOperator` | Keep explicit caveat until parity and memory gates pass. |
| `geometryScheme=1/2/3/4` | Keep analytic geometry parity and physics gates. |
| `geometryScheme=5` | VMEC wout parity, `vmec_jax` differentiable adapter lane, finite-beta QA/QH gates. |
| `geometryScheme=11/12` | Boozer `.bc` parity and memory/runtime reports. |
| `geometryScheme=13` | Decide implementation scope for direct Boozer-spectrum optimization input. |
| `export_f` | Implement distribution-function export on requested grids with bounded output sizes. |
| Matrix/vector debug dumps | Provide NPZ/netCDF debug dumps for operators/RHS/solution/preconditioner metadata. |
| HDF5 output parity | Continue adding all Fortran v3 outputs plus sfincs_jax diagnostics. |
| Classical transport | Audit term-by-term with Fortran v3 and add physics tests. |
| Input validation | Mirror Fortran v3 compatibility errors and warnings, but phrase them for Python/CLI users. |

Acceptance gates:

- A generated feature matrix in docs marks each item as implemented, tested,
  intentionally unsupported, or deferred.
- Every implemented item has at least one unit test, one behavior/regression
  test, and one docs example or reference page.
- Every unsupported/deferred item has a precise physics or engineering reason,
  not a vague "not yet".

## Lane 3 - Ambipolar Solver And Er Derivatives

Goal: make ambipolar calculations first-class, fast, and differentiable when
requested.

Implementation steps:

1. Create `sfincs_jax.problems.ambipolar` as the canonical owner.
2. Define `AmbipolarProblem`, `AmbipolarResult`, and `AmbipolarIteration`
   pytrees with solver path, residual, root type, derivative, and output fields.
3. Implement an in-process fixed-shape ambipolar driver. It must reuse parsed
   input, geometry, grids, operator metadata, factor/preconditioner setup, and
   diagnostic allocation across Er evaluations whenever the shape is unchanged.
4. Reuse the existing scan postprocessor only as a compatibility backend for
   reading completed scan directories; do not use scan-style repeated process
   launches as the primary sfincs_jax algorithm.
5. Implement Fortran-compatible radial-current conventions:
   `J_r = sum_s Z_s Gamma_s`, with the correct flux variant for `Phi1`.
6. Implement Brent with bracket provenance, monotonic interpolation diagnostics,
   and no derivative requirement.
7. Implement safeguarded Newton/bisection using `dJr/dEr`.
8. Implement pure Newton with strict derivative and trust-region guards.
9. Mirror the Fortran v3 source-code validator first:
   derivative-assisted options 1 and 3 require no `Phi1`, no inductive
   electric field, FP collisions, constraint scheme `-1` or `1`, full or DKES
   trajectory compatibility, and no tangential magnetic drifts.
10. Add a separately gated future extension for tangential-drift
    derivative-assisted ambipolar solves if the physics/operator derivatives
    are implemented.
11. Add automatic policy:
   - use derivative-assisted safeguarded Newton when an adjoint/implicit
     derivative is available and bracket is valid;
   - use Brent for robust CLI default when derivative setup is expensive;
   - fail with partial scan artifact if no bracket is found.
12. Add radial-batch ambipolar solve for profile workflows.
13. Add solve-complete/finalization separation: if diagnostics are written but
    profiling or backend finalization fails, record a warning status rather
    than marking the physical solve as failed.
14. Add CLI:
    `sfincs_jax ambipolar input.namelist --er-min ... --er-max ...`.

Derivative formula:

Given `R(u, Er, p) = 0` and `Jr(u, Er, p)`, compute

```text
du/dEr = -R_u^{-1} R_Er
dJr/dEr = partial_Er Jr + Jr_u du/dEr
```

For reverse mode, solve

```text
R_u^T lambda = Jr_u^T
dJr/dEr = partial_Er Jr - lambda^T R_Er
```

Acceptance gates:

- Reproduce Fortran v3 `ambipolarSolveOption=1/2/3` on at least one tokamak,
  one W7-X-like analytic case, one VMEC QA case, and one QH case.
- First reference reproduction target is the checked-in small probe set:
  `geometry4_w7x_like_small_option{1,2,3}` and
  `geometry1_helical_small_option2`. The Brent option-2 sequence is now covered
  by `tests/test_ambipolar_problem.py`.
- The checked `geometry1_helical_small_option1` derivative-assisted Newton
  point is now covered by `tests/test_sensitivity.py` using the active
  Fortran-style operator, `particleFlux_vm_rN`, and the implicit
  tangent/adjoint derivative certificate. The same checked small deck is also
  covered by `tests/test_ambipolar_problem.py` through the real option-1
  safeguarded Newton root solve.
- The checked small option-3 current points for helical and W7-X-like analytic
  decks are now covered by `tests/test_sensitivity.py` using the same active
  namelist-backed provider, and the helical small deck is covered by the real
  pure-Newton option-3 root solve.
- Production reference target is the checked-in production decks under
  `benchmarks/fortran_v3_ambipolar_reference/namelists`, which must be run
  before public benchmark claims are regenerated. The checked-in production
  Brent summary is now covered by `tests/test_ambipolar_problem.py`.
- `dJr/dEr` matches finite differences on a stable step window and matches the
  checked small Fortran option-1 Newton slope.
- Brent and Newton return the same root within tolerance when both are valid.
- CPU/GPU roots and root types match within tolerance for bounded cases.
- Failed brackets write a useful partial artifact and do not claim success.
- The sfincs_jax in-process ambipolar driver reports per-evaluation solver
  trace provenance and currently reuses geometry/output setup through a scoped
  cache, shape-checked Krylov state through a private state file, and symbolic
  active field-split orderings through a fixed-shape key. The remaining
  implementation gate is to avoid repeated numerical operator and
  factor/preconditioner setup when Er updates do not change the problem shape.

## Lane 4 - Adjoint Sensitivities And Differentiable Solves

Goal: replace ad hoc gradient examples with a tested derivative system aligned
with Fortran RHSMode 4/5 and modern JAX implicit differentiation.

Public APIs:

- `linearize_solve(problem, params)`
- `jvp_flux(problem, tangent_params)`
- `vjp_flux(problem, cotangent_outputs)`
- `adjoint_sensitivity(problem, objective)`
- `differentiate_ambipolar_root(problem, objective)`
- `finite_difference_check(problem, parameter, step_window)`

Implementation steps:

1. Define residual graph objects for each problem: residual, matvec, transpose
   matvec, RHS, diagnostics, and parameter leaves.
2. Ensure each residual graph has shape-stable pytrees and no hidden global
   state.
3. Use `jax.lax.custom_linear_solve` for linear solve differentiation.
4. Use `jax.linearize` for Newton/Phi1 JVPs where the nonlinear residual is
   solved in JAX.
5. Use `custom_vjp` only around public solve functions that contain adaptive
   solver choices or host-only fast paths.
6. For CLI/non-differentiable paths, return derivative-unavailable metadata
   rather than silently tracing host operations.
7. Implement Fortran-v3-style adjoint RHS builders for particle flux, heat flux,
   parallel flow, total heat flux, radial current, and bootstrap current.
8. Implement `dL/dlambda f - dS/dlambda` for:
   - `Er`,
   - Boozer `B`,
   - contravariant/covariant Boozer components,
   - `iota`,
   - radial derivative/metric terms after the exact Fortran mapping is audited.
9. Audit the exact Fortran `whichLambda` mapping before public docs, because
   comments and case labels must be reconciled term-by-term.
10. Add RHSMode 4 fixed-Er output fields.
11. Add RHSMode 5 ambipolar-Er output fields and `dPhi/dPsi` sensitivity.

Acceptance gates:

- Fortran-v3 RHSMode 4/5 input restrictions and sensitivity HDF5 field names
  are pinned against the source-code behavior.
- Small RHSMode-4 Fortran radial-current and heat-flux sensitivity summaries
  are checked in and tested; flow, bootstrap, debug finite-difference, and
  RHSMode-5 constant-current fixtures remain.
- `A^T lambda - J_u^T` adjoint residual passes for every derivative gate.
- JVP and VJP agree through dot-product tests:
  `<JVP(dp), y> = <dp, VJP(y)>`.
- Finite-difference checks pass on documented stable windows.
- Fortran v3 RHSMode 4/5 outputs match on small and intermediate grids.
- Derivative examples run under CI without full production solves.

## Lane 5 - Native Solver And Preconditioner Architecture

Goal: provide PETSc-like robustness natively in Python/JAX without depending on
PETSc, MUMPS, or SuperLU_DIST at runtime.

Fortran behavior to emulate:

- Exact operator and simplified Pmat are separate.
- Factorization is reused across RHS and adjoint solves when possible.
- Ordering and pivot safeguards are part of solver policy.
- Direct solve failure is diagnosed and retried with safer factor controls.
- Adjoints reuse transpose solves.

Implementation steps:

1. Standardize operator objects with:
   `matvec`, `transpose_matvec`, optional explicit sparse emission,
   block metadata, true residual, and parameter leaves.
2. Standardize preconditioner objects with:
   `apply`, optional `apply_transpose`, setup diagnostics, residual admission,
   memory estimate, and reuse key.
3. Keep two solver stacks:
   - differentiable stack: pure JAX matvecs, Krylov, custom linear solve,
     optional Lineax only if it improves a measured lane;
   - production stack: native Python/JAX sparse/direct/block factors and host
     rescue paths when `differentiable=False`.
4. Implement reusable symbolic ordering metadata for active-only operators.
5. Implement native sparse/block factor families:
   - line factors in `x`, `ell`, `theta`, and `zeta`;
   - block triangular/angular streaming factors;
   - active-only coupled kinetic block factors;
   - moment/source/constraint Schur complement;
   - additive Schwarz patches;
   - nested-dissection/multifrontal-inspired separator updates where beneficial.
6. Add setup-time true-residual admission for every approximate factor:
   no auto promotion without measuring residual reduction on the actual
   operator.
7. Add factor reuse across:
   - RHSMode 2/3 multiple RHS;
   - Er scans at fixed shape;
   - radial batches where geometry shape is fixed;
   - adjoint transpose solves.
8. Add fail-fast memory guards before expensive factor setup.
9. Add structured progress logging for setup and solve phases.
10. Keep lower-memory replacement as research/deferred if it cannot beat the
    existing robust path within the documented budget.

Acceptance gates:

- Auto policy selects the best passing method without environment variables.
- Strict true-residual gate passes before outputs are promoted as converged.
- Production-floor QA/QH RHSMode 1, geometry-rich RHSMode 2/3, and Phi1 cases
  either pass or are documented as deferred with exact residual/runtime/RSS.
- Runtime is no worse than 20x SFINCS Fortran v3 for public production
  comparison claims, unless a case is explicitly marked as research/deferred.
- Peak memory fits documented CPU/GPU budgets and records device memory where
  applicable.

## Lane 6 - T3D, NEOPAX, And Optimization Integration

Goal: make `sfincs_jax` useful as a transport closure in profile solvers and
stellarator optimization, not only as a standalone file-based code.

Public closures:

- `make_flux_surface_closure(geometry, species, resolution, mode)`
- `make_transport_matrix_closure(geometry, species, resolution)`
- `make_ambipolar_closure(geometry, species, resolution, er_policy)`
- `make_radial_profile_closure(geometry_provider, profile_provider, radii)`

Closure inputs:

- radius or radial grid,
- density and temperature profiles,
- density and temperature gradients,
- electric field or ambipolar policy,
- species charges/masses,
- geometry object or geometry file,
- solver/differentiability mode.

Closure outputs:

- particle fluxes,
- heat fluxes,
- parallel flows,
- bootstrap current,
- radial current,
- ambipolar roots and root type,
- transport matrices,
- derivatives/JVP/VJP when requested,
- solver certificates.

Optimization examples:

- QA nfp=2 bootstrap-current minimization.
- QA or QI electron-root targeting from ambipolarity.
- Heat and particle flux minimization with impurity-flux target.
- VMEC-JAX to Booz-Xform-JAX to SFINCS-JAX differentiable pipeline.
- T3D/NEOPAX-style radial closure using a fixed geometry and evolving profiles.

Acceptance gates:

- Examples run from a clean install without private local paths.
- Differentiable examples have finite-difference or adjoint validation.
- Non-differentiable production examples report solver path and residual.
- Docs explain when gradients are exact implicit derivatives, proxy gradients,
  or unavailable.

## Lane 7 - Validation, Physics Gates, And Coverage

Goal: reach high meaningful coverage through real physics, numerical, and
regression tests without making CI expensive.

Test tiers:

| Tier | Runtime budget | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit | seconds | Grids, coordinates, geometry, operators, collision terms, output schema. |
| Numerical | seconds to 2 min | Residual identities, transpose tests, conservation, quadrature convergence. |
| Physics gates | 2 to 8 min | Literature and Fortran v3 anchored transport/ambipolar/bootstrap checks. |
| CI regression | 5 to 10 min total | Public API, CLI, small parity, derivative gates, docs build. |
| Nightly/optional | 30 to 120 min | Production-floor CPU, GPU, Fortran v3 parity, memory/runtime. |
| Release | manual or scheduled | Full public benchmark regeneration, figures, parity matrix, artifacts. |

Physics gates to keep or add:

- Axisymmetric tokamak banana/plateau/Pfirsch-Schlueter trend checks.
- Monoenergetic DKES-style transport coefficients for W7-X/LHD/HSX analytic
  cases.
- Simakov-Helander high-collisionality limit with a pinned high-nu scan.
- QA/QH bootstrap current comparison against SFINCS Fortran v3 and Redl formula
  at identical resolution, with convergence error bars.
- W7-X ambipolarity with checked equilibrium/profile provenance.
- Finite-beta QA profile-current lane once residual convergence is clean.
- Phi1 sanity checks: flux-surface averaged lowest-order radial particle flux
  cancellation and nonlinear residual convergence.
- Adjoint sensitivity checks against finite differences and Fortran RHSMode 4/5.
- CPU/GPU reproducibility checks for representative PAS, FP, Phi1, QA, QH, and
  QI cases.

Coverage strategy:

- Aim for 95 percent meaningful package coverage after refactor, not by adding
  slow full-solve tests.
- Prefer tests on extracted pure functions and operator blocks.
- Add synthetic manufactured operators for solver/preconditioner unit tests,
  but keep every manufactured test tied to an actual operator identity.
- Keep large equilibria out of git history; fetch release fixtures only in
  optional/nightly jobs.
- Coverage gaps in host-only profiling paths can be exempted only with explicit
  comments and separate integration tests.

## Lane 8 - Benchmarks, Figures, Docs, And Release Artifacts

Goal: regenerate public claims from reproducible scripts after implementation
lanes pass.

Benchmark matrix:

- Devices/geometries: tokamak, HSX, W7-X, LHD, QA, QH, QI nfp=1/2/3/4 when
  available.
- Geometry modes: analytic, VMEC, Boozer `.bc`, direct Boozer spectrum if
  implemented.
- Physics modes: PAS, full FP, magnetic drifts on/off, Er on/off, Phi1 on/off,
  RHSMode 1/2/3/4/5 where supported.
- Resolution tiers:
  - CI tier: small but physically meaningful;
  - public benchmark tier: production-floor resolution;
  - stress tier: collaborator/NTX-like large cases.
- Devices: CPU cold/warm, GPU cold/warm, Fortran v3 reference.

Metrics:

- wall time,
- compile/setup/solve/diagnostics/output phase times,
- peak RSS,
- device memory,
- residual norm and target,
- Krylov iterations and factor setup status,
- selected solver path,
- all shared physical outputs,
- derivative residuals and finite-difference errors when applicable.

Required public figures:

- Runtime and memory comparison plot: Fortran v3, sfincs_jax CPU cold/warm,
  sfincs_jax GPU cold/warm.
- QA/QH bootstrap current: sfincs_jax, Fortran v3, Redl formula, same
  resolution, convergence error bars.
- Ambipolar Er educational/validation plot.
- Autodiff sensitivity validation plot.
- Solver phase timing plot for at least one production-floor case.
- Optional transport profile closure plot for T3D/NEOPAX-style use.

Docs requirements:

- Landing page explains the drift-kinetic equation before the discretized
  system.
- Usage page shows one CLI command, one Python solve, one plot command, and one
  differentiable objective.
- Method pages explain grids, collisions, geometry, Phi1, solvers,
  preconditioners, ambipolar solve, and adjoints.
- API pages expose stable entry points only, not internal helper churn.
- Validation pages explain every physics gate and benchmark provenance.
- Research-lane page lists only honest deferred items with exact status.

## Lane 9 - Release And Branch Hygiene

   - docs build passes;
   - CI passes;
   - release benchmark scripts complete or deferred statuses are documented;
   - README figures and docs figures are regenerated from current reports;
   - `git diff --check` passes;
   - no temporary outputs or local paths remain.
6. After review-ready and merge:

## Immediate Next Steps

Completed on 2026-06-25:

- Generated the source-audited Fortran-v3 feature matrix in
  `docs/feature_matrix.rst`.
- Added the matching `sfincs_jax` status matrix and linked it from the Sphinx
  index.
- Added sfincs_jax replay tests for the small helical option-1 and option-3
  sequences, plus a production metadata test for solver-count proxies, RSS
  bounds, PETSc marker provenance, adjoint solve counts, and residual/marker
  separation without running Fortran in CI.
- Extracted the first stable public API workflow facades:
  `sfincs_jax.write_output`, `sfincs_jax.read_output`, and
  `sfincs_jax.run_ambipolar_brent`. They are lazy wrappers over the current
  internals and are covered by fast routing tests, so future internal moves do
  not force user-facing import changes.
- Added explicit fixed-shape setup-reuse admission metadata to the real
  in-process RHSMode-1 ambipolar evaluator. Each solve records prior-state
  existence, actual state use, input/output shape signatures, admission reason,
  and cumulative same-shape reuse count; the CLI summary serializes these
  fields and tests verify cold then same-shape-warm behavior.
- Added the production-facing matrix-free implicit derivative certificate and
  ambipolar radial-current adapters. Focused tests compare matrix-free
  tangent/adjoint derivatives against the dense certificate and centered finite
  differences without assembling dense production matrices.
- Added the concrete RHSMode-1 matrix-free radial-current builder and a tiny
  real-deck comparison against the dense certificate. The builder no longer
  assembles dense matrices internally, but its operator/RHS derivative actions
  are still finite-difference based.
- Added JAX operator-tangent support to that builder and verified the JVP
  derivative action on a real electric-field `xDot` block against centered
  differences.
- Added the matrix-free derivative-provider bridge and verified that
  safeguarded Newton/bisection and pure Newton can consume it through the
  public ambipolar root-solver API.
- Added analytic no-Phi1 existing-branch `Er` operator tangents and verified
  the JVP action against centered operator differences on a real `xDot` deck.
- Added opt-in fixed-shape zero-`Er` branch retention for f-block and
  full-system operators, with a real-deck JVP gate.
- Added the first namelist-backed RHSMode-1 radial-current response helper.
  It builds fixed-shape `Er` operators from an input namelist, supplies the
  analytic/JVP `Er` tangent to the matrix-free implicit certificate, and has a
  real small-deck centered-finite-difference gate.

Next ordered implementation steps:

1. Run the production option-1/3 decks with bounded setup reuse outside normal
   CI and add replay artifacts for residuals, setup reuse, runtime, and RSS.
2. Extend the JVP/VJP dot-product gate from the current tiny no-Phi1 diagnostic
   set to Phi1 drift-current, total heat-flux, and intermediate-grid cases.
3. Add small Fortran RHSMode 4/5 output fixtures and compare exported
   sensitivity diagnostics once the no-Phi1 derivative-assisted physical gate
   is stable.
4. Define residual/operator/transpose operator protocol and migrate one
   RHSMode 2/3 path to it.
5. Add one T3D/NEOPAX-style closure example with fixed geometry and radial
   profile inputs.
6. Run focused tests, docs build, commit, and push after each coherent owner
    boundary or feature milestone.

## Known Risks And Explicit Deferred Items

- A fully native MUMPS/SuperLU_DIST-equivalent factorization stack is a large
  numerical project. The near-term target is robust native block/Schur/factor
  infrastructure with honest gates, not an overclaim that it matches mature
  sparse direct solvers on every production case.
- Full production-grid QA/QH RHSMode 1 can remain slower or higher-memory than
  Fortran v3 if residuals and outputs are correct and the limitation is
  documented. It cannot be used for favorable public performance claims unless
  the benchmark gate passes.
- True device-QI and single-case multi-GPU strong scaling remain research lanes
  until strict residual, runtime, and reproducibility gates pass.
- GeometryScheme 13 and full external-Phi1 parity require a scoped audit before
  implementation. They should not block core RHSMode 1/2/3/ambipolar/adjoint
  release milestones unless users require them.
- Lineax, JAXopt, Equinox, and other ecosystem libraries should be adopted only
  after a measured benefit. Avoid adding dependencies for conceptual elegance
  without runtime, memory, compile-time, or derivative-maintenance wins.
